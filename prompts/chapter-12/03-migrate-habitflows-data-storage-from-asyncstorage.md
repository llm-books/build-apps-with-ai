```
Migrate HabitFlow's data storage from AsyncStorage to Firestore:

1. Create src/services/firestoreService.ts that mirrors habitStorage.ts but uses Firestore:

- Store habits at users/{userId}/habits/{habitId}

- All the same functions: getAllHabits, saveHabit, updateHabit, deleteHabit, toggleCompletion, getStreak

- Use real-time listeners (onSnapshot) so changes sync instantly

2. Create Firestore security rules (print them so I can copy to Firebase console): - Users can only read/write their own habits

3. Keep AsyncStorage as an offline cache:

- Write to both Firestore and AsyncStorage

- Load from AsyncStorage first (fast), then sync from Firestore

- App should work without internet

4. On first login, migrate any existing AsyncStorage habits to Firestore

5. Update all screens to use firestoreService instead of habitStorage
