Prepare HabitFlow for Apple App Store production release:

1. Remove the temporary "Test Notification" button from Settings

2. Remove the "Generate Test Data" button from Settings if it exists

3. Remove all console.log statements from production code

4. Make sure the privacy policy URL is accessible from within the app (add it to the Settings screen under an "About" or "Legal" section)

5. Verify the app version in app.json is "1.0.0" and the iOS buildNumber is "1"

6. Make sure all Info.plist permission strings are clear and user-friendly (camera: "HabitFlow uses the camera to attach progress photos to your habits", notifications: "HabitFlow sends daily reminders for your habits at the times you choose")
